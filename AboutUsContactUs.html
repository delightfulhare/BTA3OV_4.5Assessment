                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>The Liv-ing Bouquet is a company founded in 2025 by Olivia. Olivia was working at Carleton University for a mini inrichement course. She had an idea that she built using Figma for a business website, but never had the chance to bring it to life. When she joined her Business class, she finally had a reason and the time to build an e-commerce website of her choice. She finally got the chance to bring her website to life.</p>
